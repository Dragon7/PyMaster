PyMaster is a virtual master or mistress: it dominates your life,
controlling when you are allowed to masturbate, have fun, and other such
things.

REQUIREMENTS

Just Python 3.2 or later. Once you have Python 3 installed, just execute
pymaster.py to run PyMaster. Alternatively, you can use a command such
as "python3 pymaster.py".

Windows doesn't support hashbangs, so if you are a Windows user, you
need to explicitly pass pymaster.py as an argument to Python.
Assuming the PyMaster directory is the current working directory, the
command on Windows is usually "C:\PythonXX\python.exe pymaster.py", with
"XX" replaced by the major and minor version of Python you are using.
So if you're using Python 3.4, the command you probably need to use is
"C:\Python34\python.exe pymaster.py".

This only applies to the source distribution. If you have a build
specific to your OS, just run the executable.

USAGE

Use of PyMaster is simple: first, run PyMaster for the first time;
introduce yourself to your master or mistress and listen to the rules.
Then, any time a rule requires you to talk to your master or mistress,
run PyMaster again.

PyMaster is a command-line program, so make sure you execute it inside
a terminal; otherwise it will just hang in the background and do
nothing.

Everything else will be explained by your master or mistress. Enjoy!

If you want to customize PyMaster, see extension_guide.txt.

Run PyMaster with the "-h" or "--help" argument for information about
PyMaster's command options.
