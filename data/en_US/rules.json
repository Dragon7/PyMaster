    "If you misbehave, you will be assigned punishments. You are not required to do these punishments, but I will forgive you for your misbehavior if you do.",
    "If a task or punishment you are assigned requires you to do something that normally requires permission, you have implicit permission to do it, but only if you complete the task. If you stop doing the punishment or task part-way through, anything you did that requires permission is a violation of rule 1.",
    "You must report all failures to follow these rules to me as soon as possible, before asking me for anything. Failure to report your failures before asking for something is considered to be dishonesty (lying), and you must report it as such.",
    "If you have a good reason related to your well-being to disregard one of my rules or commands (such as a medical condition), do so. In this case, it is not a violation, so please don't report it to me."
