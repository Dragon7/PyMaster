  <h1 style="text-align: center;">PyMaster: Automated Domination</h1>

  <p>Some time ago, I came across a program (ostensibly a "script", though it was really a collection of scripts) intended to act as a "cyber-mistress". I was immediately intrigued; being able to do D/s without first finding a domme? It sounded awesome! Unfortunately, that program had a number of problems: it made all kinds of assumptions about the user, it was shoddily programmed, it lacked imagination, and it was proprietary. So I decided to write a replacement for it, and PyMaster was born.</p>

  <p>PyMaster is essentially an artificial master or mistress. It dominates your life, telling you what you can and can't do. Please your master, and you will be rewarded. Disobey, and you will be punished.</p>

  <p>Compared to other automated domination programs, PyMaster has some distinctive advantages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Libre software:</strong> Released under the GNU GPL, PyMaster is completely libre software. As far as I'm aware, it is the only automated domonation program which has this distinction.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform-independent:</strong> PyMaster will run on any system that the Python interpreter runs on, including GNU/Linux, Windows, and Mac.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal Assumptions:</strong> Your master doesn't assume that you're a man, or assume that you're a woman, or assume that you have certain sex toys. It asks.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Since PyMaster is a command-line program, it is as accessible as the terminal emulator you use. Visually impaired? That's OK; PyMaster works just fine with screen readers such as Orca.</li>
    <li><strong>Realistic Personality:</strong> Your master doesn't base decisions on a rigid point system like some other autimated domination programs. Instead, all of your past actions are remembered and forgotten roughly the same way it would happen in a human, and your master determines what to do with you based on your good and bad deeds still in memory.</li>
  </ul>
