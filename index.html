  <h1 style="text-align: center;">PyMaster: Automated Domination</h1>

  <p>Some time ago, I came across a program (ostensibly a "script", though it was really a collection of scripts) intended to act as a "cyber-mistress". I was immediately intrigued; being able to do D/s without first finding a domme? It sounded awesome! Unfortunately, that program had a number of problems: it made all kinds of assumptions about the user, it was shoddily programmed, it lacked imagination, and it was proprietary. So I decided to write a replacement for it, and PyMaster was born.</p>

  <p>PyMaster is essentially an artificial master or mistress. It dominates your life, telling you what you can and can't do. Please your master, and you will be rewarded. Disobey, and you will be punished.</p>

  <p>Compared to other automated domination programs, PyMaster has some distinctive advantages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Libre software:</strong> Released under the GNU GPL, PyMaster is completely libre software. As far as I'm aware, it is the only automated domination program which has this distinction.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform-independent:</strong> PyMaster will run on any system that the Python interpreter runs on, including GNU/Linux, Windows, and Mac.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal Assumptions:</strong> Your master doesn't assume that you're a man, or assume that you're a woman, or assume that you have certain sex toys. It asks.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Since PyMaster is a command-line program, it is as accessible as the terminal emulator you use. Visually impaired? That's OK; PyMaster works just fine with screen readers such as Orca.</li>
    <li><strong>Realistic Personality:</strong> Your master doesn't base decisions on a rigid point system like some other automated domination programs. Instead, all of your past actions are remembered and forgotten roughly the same way it would happen in a human, and your master determines what to do with you based on your good and bad deeds still in memory.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contribute to PyMaster</h2>

  <p>I would greatly appreciate one particular type of contribution: ideas. Namely, ideas for tasks (things to make the slave do for the amusement of the master), punishments, and birthday gifts. If you have an idea for any of these, please send them to me so I can add them in! :) You can either open an issue with your suggestion on the GitHub page, or you can send an email to my mailbox at <a href="mailto:FreedomOfRestriction@openmailbox.org">FreedomOfRestriction@openmailbox.org</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm capable of maintaining the programming side of PyMaster myself, so I'm not particularly interested in programming contributions, but they would be accepted as well. One thing in particular you could do is create an alternative graphical interface for PyMaster using Tkinter or something. PyMaster is already designed with this task in mind; you only need to rewrite (most of) the pymasterlib.message module.</p>

  <p>If you know a second language, you can also help by translating. All important text in PyMaster is found under the data folder; simply create a new subdirectory, copy the contents of data/en_US, and begin translating. :)</p>
